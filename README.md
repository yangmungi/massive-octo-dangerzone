=======================

Abstract: Automatically commits to Git.

Contains a small number of scripts that shall generate a bunch of ASCII non-sense!
It shall also commit these change into the local Git repository, and then it shall push them to the remote, 'worker'.

This is a dangerous script, it SHALL fill up your storage if you are NOT CAREFUL.

The primary function of this was to test Github Web-hooks while practicing some Bash, and making everything feel meta.
